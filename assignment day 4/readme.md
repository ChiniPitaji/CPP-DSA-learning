Read up about the difference between typedef (keyword), macros & const (keyword) in C++.

-> typedef keyword in C++ is used for aliasing existing data types, user-defined data types, and pointers to a more meaningful name.                                                                                                Eg : typedef int myInt                                                                                       This allows us to declare new integers using myInt, instead of int.

->Macros can be of any type. Macros can even be any code block containing statements, loops, function calls etc. They are expanded by the preprocessor before compilation takes place.

->const keyword is used to define the constant value that cannot change during program execution.
